# go-proto
<font size="18">The collection of data structures and some algorithms in Go.</font>
<br>
<font size="16">
A collection of ready-to-import Go packages, which are friendly in usage. They provide
a quite wide functionality, ensuring a somewhat good performance.
<br>
This collection takes advantage of the reflect, fmt and errors packages mostly. 
<br>
The structures are capable of holding any type of data, though not for certain structures,
such as set or tree.
<br>
Lots of functions are provided with these structures in order to ensure flexibility.
<br>
To install the structures, copy the .go files from this repository to the src/proto
folder, where src is specified in your Go path (GOPATH).
